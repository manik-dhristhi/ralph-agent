# Execution Skills

## Overview
These skills guide HOW to approach and execute tasks. They provide methodology,
quality standards, and best practices for iterative work.

## Workflow Pattern

### Phase 1: Planning (First Iteration)
1. Analyze the task requirements thoroughly
2. Break down into logical components/modules
3. Create an outline or structure document
4. Define success criteria

### Phase 2: Building (Middle Iterations)
1. Work on one component at a time
2. Complete each component before moving to the next
3. Test/validate as you go
4. Document important decisions

### Phase 3: Refinement (Later Iterations)
1. Review completed work for consistency
2. Add any missing pieces
3. Polish and improve quality
4. Create summary/overview documentation

## Quality Standards
- Each output file should be complete and standalone
- Use clear, descriptive names for files and folders
- Include comments/documentation where appropriate
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout
- Build incrementally - don't try to do everything at once

## Iteration Strategy
- Each iteration should complete 1 focused task
- Tasks should produce tangible output files
- Earlier iterations focus on structure and foundation
- Later iterations focus on content and polish
- Always review previous work before starting new work
- Keep iterations lightweight to manage rate limits effectively

## Output Organization
```
output/
├── README.md              # Overview and index
├── 01-{first-section}/    # First major section
│   └── ...
├── 02-{second-section}/   # Second major section
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Best Practices
- Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- Prefer many small files over few large files
- Use numbered prefixes for ordering (01-, 02-, etc.)
- Keep related content together in folders
- Update the README.md as you add content
- Leave clear notes for the next iteration

## Common Patterns

### For Documentation/Content Tasks
1. Create outline first
2. Write section by section
3. Review and connect sections
4. Add introduction and conclusion

### For Code/Technical Tasks
1. Set up project structure first
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add supporting features
4. Write tests and documentation

### For Research Tasks
1. Gather sources and references
2. Organize information by topic
3. Synthesize findings
4. Create summary report
